# Iris_Flower_Classifiaction
## Overview
This project analyzes the **Iris dataset**, a classic dataset in machine learning.  
It contains 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

The target variable is **species**, which has **3 classes**:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

The goal of this project is to **predict the species of iris flowers** using their features.

## Project Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Checked first few rows and dataset shape  
   - Checked for missing values  
   - Visualized features using pairplot, boxplot, heatmap, and scatter plots  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Separated features (`X`) and target (`y`)  
   - Performed train-test split  

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest Classifier 
   - Evaluated models using **accuracy score** and **confusion matrix**  

4. **Prediction**  
   - Demonstrated predicting the species for a sample input.

## Results
- All models achieved high accuracy due to clean dataset.  
- Petal length and petal width are the most important features for classification.
